# Usage:
- Enter The **Randomly Generated Verification Number** That is Printed By The Script To Continue
- Enter "**E**" Or "**D**" To Either _Encrypt_ Or _Decrypt_ Files In Script Directory
- ***Watch The Magic Happen!***
# How It Works:
### Starting Point:
First You'll Be Prompted With A Verification Number From **500 To 5000** Which Then Needs To Be Inputed By The User For The Script To Continue
- Example:

### Encryption:
- The Script Will Print Found Files In **os.listdir()** (Script Directory)

- Decryption Key (Fernet Key) Will Be **Created And Copied To Clipboard** Using *pyperclip*:

- Decryption Key Will Be **Written By The Script** In A File Called "**Decryption_Key.key**", Which Is **Ignored** Alongside The Script During Encrypting And Decrypting:

- Script Will Print "**File Encrypted.**" Everytime A File Is Encrypted By The Script:

- Once All Files Are Encrypted, The Script Prints That All Files Have Been **Encrypted**, And Will Also Print **Credits To Me** (***ChronZ/Pulsed***):

### Decryption:
- The Script Will Print Found Files In **os.listdir()** (Script Directory)
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105559308/175816456-5614583a-8b35-4fa7-b6b0-da0eeb120979.png)

- Script Will Notify You By Printing When It Has **Read The Decryption Key**:

- Script Will Print "**File Decrypted.**" Everytime A File Is Encrypted By The Script:

- Once All Files Are Decrypted, The Script Prints That All Files Have Been **Decrypted**, And Will Also Print **Credits To Me** (***ChronZ/Pulsed***):
